# OmniHistoryPlus - Full History Search from the Omnibar

[![OmniHistoryPlus Promo Image](img/OmniHistoryPlusPromo.png)]

This lightweight extension allows you to search your entire browse history, rather than what the omnibar usually trims it down to.

In the omnibar, just type 'f' followed by a tab or space to activate this feature, then type what you want to search for. 

Results are displayed in the omnibar, but you'll find they go beyond what it normally displays, letting to get to the results you want.

Inspired by [Fauxbar](https://github.com/ChrisNZL/Fauxbar), which was an awesome extension by ChrisNZL, but isn't compatible with Manifest v3.
